# 3D Project Test

This is a quick project to see play around with plugging Cinema 4D models into a JS environment with ThreeJS. Which means I can revitalise my 3d modeling skills!!

## Models
Export models as `gltf` or `glb`, as this seems to be a common format for use in ThreeJs, I've stored these in `public/models` for use. I've also included the C4D files in the root `models` folder.

## Running locally
`npm i` then `npm run dev`
